    <h1>AutoTrain Competition</h1>

    <p>
      Design a robust optimizer for any Machine Learning architecture.
      Submit your optimizer to this challenge at the <a href="https://appliedmldays.org/">Applied Machine Learning Day 2020</a> and make an impact in the research of ML practitioners.
    </p>

    <p>
    AutoTrain challenges you to submit optimizers that work reliably on any deep learning task without task-specific tuning. It separates AutoML into (1) fully automatic training of a model and (2) model selection, and tackles the first aspect. Your submissions will be benchmarked on a secret set of architecture/dataset pairs inspired by common deep learning tasks. The optimizers need to achieve a target test loss as fast as possible. The fastest on average wins the competition. The winning optimizers will be made publicly available as open source and bring significant value to practitioners and researchers, by removing the need of expensive hyperparameter tuning, and by providing fair benchmarking of all optimizers.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    We provide a <a href="https://github.com/epfml/autoTrain/blob/master/train.py">starter kit</a> with a sample submission file <code>train.py</code>.
    A good start is to slightly modify our Adam optimizer and test it on the task provided in <code>example_tasks/</code>.

    <h2>Rules and Submission</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Submission deadline:</b> Friday, January 15th, 6pm (Swiss time).
      </p>

      You are required to submit a ZIP file before the deadline to <a href="mailto:autotrain@groupes.epfl.ch">autotrain@groupes.epfl.ch</a> containing:
      <ul>
        <li><code>README.md</code> team name and team members,</li>
        <li><code>train.py</code> code of your optimizer,</li>
        <li><code>report.pdf</code> 4 pages (two-columns) report describing your submission.</li>
      </ul>

      Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/epfml/autoTrain">Github repository</a> for the rules.

    <h2>Prizes</h2>

    The teams submitting the best performing optimizers will receive the following prices as AWS voucher:

    <ul>
      <li>1st place: 1000 CHF</li>
      <li>2nd place: 500 CHF</li>
      <li>3rd place: 300 CHF</li>
    </ul>

    As we also value the reusability of the code and the clarity and novelty of the idea backing this implementation,
    the organization committee will award 200CHF to the best report.
    This reward can be cumulated with the rewards based on the ranking.
